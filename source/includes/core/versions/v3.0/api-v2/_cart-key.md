## What is a Cart Key? ##

A cart key is what identifies the cart stored in session along with it's cart data and expiration. This is normally stored in a [cookie](#cookie) and is used to load the cart in session if the cart still exists.

If used via the global parameter it will help identify a guest customers cart.

    If you try to identify a registered user via the cart key then you will be asked to authenticate as that user instead.

## Accessing the Cart Key ##

If cookies don't work for you due to the limitations of the framework your using to build with, then don't worry. The cart key created for the customer is returned in the cart response and via the returned headers once the first API request has been made. This is helpful for supporting guest customers.

Look for `X-CoCart-API` and you will see the value of the cart key returned. You can then use this to set the `cart_key` parameter with any of the CoCart API routes to load this cart.

<aside class="warning">
    The <code>cart_key</code> parameter is a global parameter so it must be queried rather than being added as part of the data you send with the API request you make. Otherwise it will not update the cart.

## Creating a Cart Key ##

If you are creating a cart key of your own, it cannot be longer than **42 characters** as that is the limit for storing the key in the database.
