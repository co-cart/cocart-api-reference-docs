In order to access your products, you need to have the [CoCart Products add-on](https://cocart.xyz/add-ons/products/?utm_medium=docs.cocart.xyz&utm_source=docs&utm_content=cocart-docs).

It's a public API that provides access to non-sensitive product information, categories, tags, attributes and even reviews from your store without the need to authenticate.

Supports other products types created by WooCommerce extensions such as Subscriptions and more.
