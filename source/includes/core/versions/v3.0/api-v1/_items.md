Once items are in the cart, customers always make decisions on which items they want to buy now, change the quantities of a particular item and which items they should remove.

The following API's help with all of that.

 * [Count Items](#items-in-cart-count-items)
 * [Remove Item from Cart](#items-in-cart-remove-item-from-cart)
 * [Restore Item to Cart](#items-in-cart-restore-item-to-cart)
 * [Update Item in Cart](#items-in-cart-update-item-in-cart)
