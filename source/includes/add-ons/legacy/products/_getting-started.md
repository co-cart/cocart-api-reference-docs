## Recommended Version ##

For the most stable and performance experience, it’s recommended that you use the most recent version of the plugin. You can get the [latest releases here](https://cocart.xyz/?utm_medium=docs.cocart.xyz&utm_source=docs&utm_content=cocart-docs).

Of course, as new features are in development, feel free to check out the latest develop branch or check out any [other release](https://github.com/co-cart/co-cart/releases).

## GitHub - Download / Clone Plugin ##

CoCart Products is available on GitHub: <https://github.com/co-cart/cocart-products>

The plugin is hosted there on a public GitHub repository in order to better facilitate community contributions from developers and users alike.

You can [download the latest release](https://github.com/co-cart/cocart-products/releases/latest) or clone the plugin from GitHub.

Add the downloaded/cloned plugin to your WordPress plugin directory. On a typical WordPress install, this is located at `/wp-content/plugins`.

<aside class="notice">
    <strong>Install Directory</strong><br/><br/>To minimize risk of unintended behaviour, it’s best for your plugin directory to be "cocart-products" and not something else, like "cocart-products-master" or "cocart-products-develop".
